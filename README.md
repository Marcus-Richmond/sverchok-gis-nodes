# sverchok-gis-nodes

Custom GIS nodes for sverchok addon for blender


## goal

Eventually, I'd like to create an addon for sverchok with nodes for importing GIS data. I am fairly new to programming, so this project has a long way to go. For now, this repository is meant to store all code written for this addon, but is not a working addon.
